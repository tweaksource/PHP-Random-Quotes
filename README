Description: This is a simple, single-file (plus an xml file) solution for reading in an XML document defining quotes and authors into an array, and then displaying a randomly selected quote and its author on a web page. 

Usage: Place the getQuotes.php file and the quotes .xml file in the appropriate directory and include the getQuotes.php where you wish to display the quote:

<?php include('getQuotes.php'); ?>

I include the quote in a <div> and style it accordingly.
